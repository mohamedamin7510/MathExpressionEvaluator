# Math Expression Evaluator
- This project for evaluating any math expression with any given way as an interpreter  like sin 90 ,cos 90 ,tan 45 , 2 ^3 , 2 pow 3 and exc
- the program.cs class is will go to App.cs class ,he'll responsible in taking the input 
- After That, is trasnsmitted to ExpressionParser  to do two operation laxics analysis and  syntax analysis as a compiler phases architecture but more simply 
- and the outpout is token with helping both MathExpression class to store left side operand (first token) and Right side operand (third token) and using MathOperation class to store the operation (second token)
- return  tokenes to App.cs class again to do an operatione on it in acoording to the second token and print the result ........ 

# Number Processing Algorithms in C#

## Description
This repository contains efficient C# implementations for solving mathematical problems such as:
- Checking if a number is a power of two
- Determining whether a number is prime
- Computing the sum of a range efficiently
- Finding the XOR-based sequence value

Each algorithm is optimized for large input constraints.

## Features
- Bitwise optimization for checking power of two
- Efficient \( O(\sqrt{N}) \) prime checking algorithm
- Fast summation using direct formulas for even/odd numbers
- XOR-based sequence calculation using modular indexing

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK installed
- Basic knowledge of C# syntax

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
