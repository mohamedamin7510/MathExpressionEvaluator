# Math Expression Evaluator

## Description
This repository contains efficient C# implementations for calculating mathematical problems such as:
- Calculating numbers are power of number [`sin 90 ,cos 90 ,tan 45 , 2 ^3 , 2 pow 3 and exc`]
- Computing the sum of a range efficiently

### The `[Program.cs class]` will go to `[App.cs class]` .He'll responsible on talking the input. After that, it trasnsmit to `[ExpressionParser]` to do
### two operation laxics analysis and syntax analysis as compiler phases architecture. But more simply and The outpout is token with helping both
### [MathExpression class] to store left side operand `first token`  and  Right side operand ` third token ` and using [MathOperation class] to
### store the operation 'second token'.
### return tokenes to [App.cs class] again to do an operation on it in acoording to the second token and print the result ........

Each algorithm is optimized for large input constraints.
