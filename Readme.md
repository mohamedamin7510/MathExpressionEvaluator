- This project for evaluating any math expression with any given way as an interpreter  like 
- the program.cs class is will go to App.cs class ,he'll responsible in taking the input 
- After That, is trasnsmitted to ExpressionParser  to do two operation laxics analysis and  syntax analysis as a compiler phases architecture but more simply 
- and the outpout is token with helping both MathExpression class to store left side operand (first token) and Right side operand (third token) and using MathOperation class to store the operation (second token)
- return  tokenes to App.cs class again to do an operatione on it in acoording to the second token and print the result ........ 

# Math Expression Evaluator

## Description
This repository contains efficient C# implementations for calculating mathematical problems such as:
- Calculating numbers are power of number [`sin 90 ,cos 90 ,tan 45 , 2 ^3 , 2 pow 3 and exc`]
- Computing the sum of a range efficiently


Each algorithm is optimized for large input constraints.
